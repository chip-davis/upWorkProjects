All of my upwork jobs for clients.

FBM Records contains a twitter bot built for a client that tracks a list of over 400 users. It retweets any tweet that those users either tweet, reply, or retweet that contain
certain keywords. In this case, it is relating to NBA Topshot. It uses tweepy as well as Twitters API V1.1. 

Class ID editor was only a couple simple additions to an existing codebase to modify class ID numbers generated by YoloV3

excelReporter contains a Python script that would read an excel file of variable length and create a PDF report based on that data. It takes optional subheadings as input via a
text file that follows a format similiar to a dictionary. There is a version with a GUI using DearPYGUI but the code for that is a bit of a mess.

XMLReformatter was a job for a client that had a base XML file with a couple thousand lines that was a quick and easy job. Attached are the desired start and end files.
